## Why Idempotency.Net?

Duplicate API calls are a constant threat in distributed systems. Whether it's a double payment, a duplicate order, or a retried webhook — idempotency is essential.

Existing solutions like [IdempotentAPI]([https://github.com/myjhdevelopment/IdempotentAPI](https://github.com/ikyriak/IdempotentAPI)) are powerful, but they require **multiple NuGet packages, external locking libraries, and verbose configuration**.

**Idempotency.Net** gives you the same guarantees with **one package, one line of configuration, and zero external dependencies** for distributed locking.

## Features

- 🛡️ **Guaranteed exactly‑once execution** – distributed locking prevents race conditions even under concurrent requests.
- 🔌 **Pluggable storage** – Redis, PostgreSQL, or In‑Memory (for development/testing).
- 🧘 **Minimal setup** – install one package, add one line to `Program.cs`, apply an attribute.
- ⚙️ **Flexible configuration** – customizable key header, TTL, lock timeouts.
- 🧪 **Integration‑tested** – tested against real Redis and PostgreSQL containers via Testcontainers.
- 🏗️ **Production‑ready** – built on `NpgsqlDataSource`, `StackExchange.Redis`, and modern .NET practices.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the package

Choose your storage:

```bash
dotnet add package Idempotency.Net.Redis
# or
dotnet add package Idempotency.Net.PostgreSql
